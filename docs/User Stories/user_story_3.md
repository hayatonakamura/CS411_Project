# User Story 3

*As a college student, I want to be able to accurately track my emotion through the school week.*
School is a stressful environment, as there are many factors that can influence my daily mood, whether it’s the amount of sleep I am getting every night, or the type of food I ate in the morning. Many of my friends tell me that they find it hard to tell when I am happy, since my regular face looks unhappy, even though I am internally happy. I would like to have an application that knows exactly what my mood is, instead of the mood it looks like I am in. 
The app can satisfy this user need by showing several photos that it took during the day and asking the user what kind of mood each photo corresponds to. Additionally, the user may also correct the predicted mood on the spot by telling the application that their mood is in fact happy, not sad, or vice versa. By repeating these steps, the system should have a good idea on what the user’s mood is, regardless of the difficulty in accurately reading their emotion.
