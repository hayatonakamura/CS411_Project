The framework our team chose to use is Express + Node.js. We had also considered python framework such as Django and Flask at the beginning since all of us more or less has some experience with programming in python. However, we finally decided to use Javascript because it is now one of the most popular language in the world, and we do not have much chance to get to know it well in traditional computer science courses. Therefore, we believe this is a great opportunity to learn and practice it through doing a web development project. In addition, in terms of resources, Javascript has many strong and useful libraries like jQuery and React that can help us to implement a bunch of cool features to our project.
