The framework our team chose to use is Express + Node.js. We have also considered python framework such as Django and Flask at the beginning since all of us more or less has some experience with programming in python. However, we finally decided to use Javascript because it is now one of the most popular language in the world and is especially powerful in web developent, and we do not have much chance to get to know it well in traditional computer science courses. Therefore, we believe this is a great opportunity to learn and practice it through doing a web development project. In addition, in terms of resources, Javascript has many strong and useful libraries like jQuery and React that can help us to implement a bunch of cool features in our project. Unlike Python, Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment designed to use Javascript on web servers, manage computing resources, file systems, and web application security. It's one of a few server-side solutions based on the concept of event-driven programming, which allows creating highly scalable servers without threading, which is perfect for the purpose of our project. On top of that, Node supports multiple concurrent requests and operations via asynchronous calls and non-blocking I/O.
