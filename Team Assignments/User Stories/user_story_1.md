*As a college student, I want to be able to listen to music that matches my emotions to balance my emotional state, and help myself be more productive.*
For instance, I have diverse emotions and it changes everyday because of relationships with friends, school work, and grades. Depending on my level of happiness, excitement, or sadness, I want to listen music that enhances my feeling. Once I log in to my account, the app should recognizes my level of emotion by analyzing my face. My account should have listed music category that I choose from Spotify. Then, I want the app to play the specific genre of music that reflects my current mood. 
 
I am a type of the person who plays the music all the time regardless of how I am feeling. However, it is hard for me to play music that I want to listen to at a certain moment. For instance, when I study for an exam, I want to listen to calm and quiet instrumental music instead of pop songs. Since I do not know the names of all music that involves in different categories, I sometimes struggle to find the genre and name of music I want to listen to. I hope this web app can resolve my issue by playing the appropriate category of music depending on my emotions. Another example is when I feel excited because I had a fun night with my friends, then I want the app to turn on party music such as EDM (Electronic Dance Music) or hip hop. These different styles of music should enhance my mood and help my music-choosing struggles.
